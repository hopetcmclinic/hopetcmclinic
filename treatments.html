            <strong>Acupuncture</strong> is sterilized filiform disposable needles inserted into the patient's body at specific angles and depths,

    in accordance with the principles and theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Meridian. Needling techniques twisting and lifting, are employed to stimulate precise areas of the human body. This is done to achieve the purpose of harmonizing and regulating the flow of Qi and blood. These specific insertion points are called acupoints.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>FSN (Fu's Subcutaneous Needling)</strong> originated from TCM, but the insertion points are different from traditional acupoints. FSN only goes into the subcutaneous layer (between skin and muscle) where collagen fibres are most abundant. It treats different kinds of pain and chronic diseases that are related to muscle tightness. Muscle tightness could cause insufficient blood and oxygen to run through the muscles which leads to pain. The FSN technique is to sway the needle between the skin and the muscle. This triggers a response in the connective tissue to help relax the tightened muscle, promote Qi and blood flow, and immediately relieve the pain.

        <strong>Traditional Chinese Herbs</strong> are mainly plant-based, but some preparations include minerals or animal products. Different herbs have different properties that can balance particular parts of the body. Each herbal prescription is made specifically to fit each individual, based on the practitioner's diagnosis. The prescription normally contains a group of different herbs that work together to reset the balance. Nowadays, herbs are made into granules to make them easier to take.

        <strong>Cupping</strong> is a method of relieving local congestion by applying a partial vacuum that is created in a cup, either by heat or by suction.

        <strong>Auricular acupuncture</strong> refers to a method of diagnosing and treating diseases by using short needles or other methods such as small black seeds of cow-herb to stimulate ear points. There are certain physiological connections between the ear and various parts of the human body. Looking at the shape and colour of the ears can assist in diagnosing diseases, and stimulating acupoints on the ears can prevent and treat diseases.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Moxibustion</strong> uses pre-made moxibustion sticks or mugwort floss on or over the acupoints and uses thermal stimulation to prevent and treat diseases.

        <strong>Gua Sha (Scraping)</strong> is a traditional East Asian medicine healing technique that applies instrument-assisted unidirectional press-stroking of a lubricated area of the body surface to intentionally create transitory therapeutic petechiae representing extravasation of blood in the hypodermis.
