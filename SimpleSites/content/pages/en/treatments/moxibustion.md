<p class="mb-6">
Moxibustion, often referred to as "moxa," traces its origins back thousands of years in China. It involves the burning of mugwort, a herb with purported healing properties, to stimulate specific points on the body. At the core of moxibustion lies the fundamental principle of TCM – the balance and flow of Qi.

Moxibustion aims to restore harmony and promote healing by stimulating the flow of Qi and enhancing the body's innate ability to heal itself. It is especially renowned for dispelling cold and dampness from the body.
