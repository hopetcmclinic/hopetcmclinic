<h3 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">Gua Sha (Scraping) Technique</h3>
<p class="mb-6">
Gua Sha is a traditional healing technique that involves scraping your skin with a smooth-edged tool (often made of jade, horn, or ceramic) to improve circulation. "Gua" means to scrape, and "Sha" refers to the reddish, sandy-looking petechiae that appear on the skin after treatment. This redness encourages the body to release healing factors and clear stagnation.

<h3 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">Benefits</h3>
<p class="mb-6">
Gua Sha is particularly effective for:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Musculoskeletal Pain:</strong> Great for chronic neck, shoulder, and back pain.</li>
    <li><strong>Breaking Down Scar Tissue:</strong> Helps reduce fibrosis and improve mobility.</li>
    <li><strong>Treating Colds:</strong> Often used in the early stages of a cold to release "wind" and pathogens from the body.</li>
    <li><strong>Improving Circulation:</strong> Moves stagnant blood and energy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">What to Expect</h3>
<p class="mb-6">
The practitioner applies massage oil to the skin and uses the tool to apply pressure in long strokes. While it can look intense due to the redness, the treatment provides relief from tension and pain. The marks ("Sha") typically fade within 2 to 4 days.
