<h2 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">Embrace Timeless Beauty</h2>
<p class="mb-6">
Embrace a holistic approach to beauty that goes beyond surface level. <strong>Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture</strong> is a luxurious, natural alternative to invasive procedures and Botox. It doesn't just treat your skin; it treats <em>you</em>. Rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), this therapy revitalizes your complexion by balancing the body’s internal energy, promoting health that radiates from the inside out.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
It is time to celebrate your vitality and enhance your natural glow with a treatment that honors your body's wisdom.
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">The Science: Awakening Your Skin's Potential</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
How does it work? The magic lies in your body's own healing capability.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Micro-Trauma Theory:</strong> We use ultra-thin, specialized needles to create tiny, painless "micro-traumas" in the skin. This signals your body to go into repair mode, stimulating the production of <strong>collagen and elastin</strong>—the proteins responsible for firm, plump, and youthful skin.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced Circulation:</strong> The treatment significantly increases local blood circulation and oxygenation. This brings a fresh supply of nutrients to the skin cells while flushing out metabolic waste, resulting in a clearer, more vibrant complexion.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">Key Benefits</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
More than just an aesthetic treatment, Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture offers a "natural face-lift" with benefits that extend to your overall well-being:
</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Soften Fine Lines & Wrinkles:</strong> Naturally fills in resting lines and softens deep grooves.</li>
    <li><strong>Lift & Tone:</strong> Combats sagging by tightening facial muscles and improving skin elasticity.</li>
    <li><strong>Brighten Complexion:</strong> transforms dullness into a healthy, rosy glow.</li>
    <li><strong>Clear & Balance:</strong> Effective in treating acne, hormonal breakouts, and calming rosacea.</li>
    <li><strong>Internal Harmony:</strong> Since we treat the constitutional root, you may also experience better sleep, reduced stress, and balanced digestion.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">The Procedure: A Ritual of Self-Care</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
Your session is designed to be a relaxing, restorative experience.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
Unlike body acupuncture, facial needles are <strong>extremely thin and hair-like</strong>, ensuring comfort. We gently place these needles at specific points on the face, ears, and body to unblock energy channels.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
To elevate results, we often integrate complementary therapies such as <strong>Gua Sha</strong> (facial scraping) or <strong>Jade Rolling</strong>. These techniques further boost lymphatic drainage, reduce puffiness, and sculpt facial contours.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Course of Treatment:</strong> True rejuvenation is a journey. For lasting, visible results, a course of <strong>10 sessions</strong> is typically recommended (usually once or twice a week). Maintenance sessions can then be scheduled to keep your glow vibrant.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">Is This For You?</h2>

<p class="mb-6">
Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture fits perfectly into a lifestyle of conscious self-care.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Preventative Care (20s & 30s):</strong> An excellent way to delay the signs of aging, maintain collagen levels, and prevent deep lines from forming.</li>
    <li><strong>Restorative Care (40s+):</strong> A powerful tool to reverse visible signs of aging, restore firmness, and bring life back to tired skin.</li>
</ul>
