<h3 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">Introduction</h3>
<p class="mb-6">
In the intricate tapestry of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), cupping stands as a practice steeped in centuries of history and revered for its profound therapeutic benefits. Originating in ancient China and transcending cultural boundaries, cupping has emerged as a timeless healing modality that continues to captivate and intrigue both practitioners and enthusiasts worldwide.

<h3 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">How It Works</h3>
<p class="mb-6">
Cupping therapy involves the application of glass, bamboo, or plastic cups to the skin, creating a vacuum-like suction that draws superficial tissues into the cup. This suction effect stimulates blood flow, loosens fascia and muscles, and encourages the release of toxins and stagnation, all aimed at restoring balance and promoting healing within the body.

<p class="mb-6">
In Traditional Chinese Medicine philosophy, cupping is based on the principle of promoting the smooth flow of Qi (vital energy) and blood throughout the body's meridian system. It is believed that disruptions or blockages in this flow can lead to imbalances and disease. By applying cups to specific acupuncture points or areas of tension, cupping therapy aims to clear stagnation, enhance circulation, and facilitate the body's innate ability to heal itself.

    <li><strong>Wet cupping:</strong> Incorporating a small incision to draw out stagnant blood or toxins.</li>
    <li><strong>Moving cupping:</strong> Gliding the cups over oiled skin to massage and release tension.</li>
