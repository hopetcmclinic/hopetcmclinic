<h3 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">Nature's Pharmacy</h3>
<p class="mb-6">
Herbal medicine is a cornerstone of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), harnessing the therapeutic properties of plants and minerals to address a wide range of health conditions. Unlike western pharmaceuticals which often target specific symptoms, herbal formulations are meticulously crafted to treat the underlying root cause of your condition.

<h3 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">Personalized Formulations</h3>
<p class="mb-6">
At Hope TCM Clinic, we don't believe in "one size fits all." Your herbal prescription is personalized based on your unique constitution, pulse, tongue diagnosis, and specific symptoms. A formula might contain anywhere from 5 to 15 different herbs, working synergistically to restore balance to your body.
</p>

<h3 class="subtitle text-2xl font-serif text-primary mb-4">Granule Herbs</h3>
<p class="mb-6">
For your convenience and safety, we primarily use high-quality concentrated herbal granules. These are easy to take—simply dissolve them in warm water like tea. This avoids the need for time-consuming boiling of raw herbs while ensuring potency and consistency.
