    - q: "How to prepare for my first visit?"
      a: "Please complete the online intake and consent forms before your appointment (approx. 10 mins). Alternatively, you can fill them out in person upon arrival. It’s a good idea to have a light meal or snack 1–2 hours before your treatment. Avoid consuming coffee or other stimulating beverages before your visit."
    - q: "How many treatments will I need?"
      a: "It varies by condition. Acute issues may resolve quickly, while chronic conditions often require ongoing care for reliable results. Consistent acupuncture treatments typically lead to reliable results."
    - q: "Are there side effects?"
      a: "Most people experience positive effects such as increased relaxation or a feeling of deep calm. Some may feel energized or even slightly giddy. These reactions vary from person to person, but the calming effects of acupuncture often last throughout the day. We recommend resting for the remainder of the day to allow your body to process the treatment. If you experience significant effects, please arrange for a safe journey home."
