  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  entries:
    - q: "Does acupuncture hurt?"
      a: "Most people feel little to no pain. You may notice mild soreness, heaviness, fullness, or a warm or radiating sensation, which is normal. Occasionally, a brief sharp or electrical feeling may occur if there is significant stagnation in the meridian or a small blood vessel or nerve is irritated. If this happens, let your practitioner know—they can quickly adjust the needle to relieve the discomfort."
    - q: "How long does an acupuncture session last?"
      a: "Your initial visit lasts 90 minutes, including consultation and treatment. Follow-up sessions are 60 minutes."
    - q: "How many treatments will I need?"
      a: "It varies by condition. Acute issues may resolve quickly, while chronic conditions often require ongoing care for reliable results. Consistent acupuncture treatments typically lead to reliable results."
    - q: "Is acupuncture covered by insurance?"
      a: "Yes, most Extended Health Plans in British Columbia cover acupuncture treatments by a Registered Acupuncturist (R.Ac.). We provide detailed receipts that you can submit to your insurance for reimbursement. Check your specific plan for coverage limits."      
    - q: "Do you do direct billing?"
      a: "No, we do not do direct billing. We provide detailed receipts that you can submit to your insurance for reimbursement."
    - q: "What payment methods do you accept?"
      a: "We accept debit/credit cards, e-transfer, and cash. A detailed receipt will be issued after each session for insurance claims."
