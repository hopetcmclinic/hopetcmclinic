    </p><br>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>
        A thorough assessment is the first step to understanding your current health condition, identifying any imbalances, and addressing your unique needs.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        During your first visit, your acupuncturist will discuss your health history, lifestyle, and any symptoms or concerns. This initial assessment includes a detailed physical exam, which may involve checking your pulse, examining your tongue, and discussing your overall well-being to create a customized treatment plan.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        Follow-up sessions focus on your progress. Your acupuncturist will assess any changes, adjust your treatment as needed, and support your body’s natural healing process, addressing emerging symptoms as they arise.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        <a href="/blogs/acupuncture.html"><strong>Acupuncture</strong></a> uses ultra-thin, sterile needles inserted at precise angles and depths to stimulate specific areas of the body, called acupoints. This harmonizes and regulates the flow of Qi and blood, promoting both physical and emotional balance. Our acupuncturists are proficient in various techniques, including:

        Each technique is chosen based on your unique condition to achieve the best possible results.

    <p>
        <a href="/blogs/cupping.html"><strong>Cupping</strong></a> involves placing cups on the skin to create gentle suction, which encourages blood flow, relieves muscle tension, and reduces inflammation.
    </p><br>

    <p>        
        <a href="/blogs/moxibustion.html"><strong>Moxibustion</strong></a> warms and invigorates Qi by burning dried mugwort (moxa) near the skin. This therapy is especially helpful for cold or stagnant conditions and works harmoniously with acupuncture.
    </p><br>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Scraping (Gua Sha)</strong> uses a smooth-edged tool to gently scrape the skin, increasing blood flow and reducing inflammation. Scraping is highly effective in relieving muscle tension, improving mobility, and aiding detoxification.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        <strong>Traditional Chinese Herbal</strong> custom formulas may be prescribed to complement your acupuncture treatments. These traditional remedies target a variety of health concerns, restoring balance and supporting your body’s natural healing process.
    </p><br>

    <p>
        <a href="/blogs/facial-rejuvenation-acupuncture.html"><strong>Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture</strong></a> offers a holistic approach to revitalizing both the body and face. By balancing your body’s energy and improving blood flow to the face, this treatment can help smooth wrinkles, improve skin tone, and support a healthy, youthful glow. The treatment stimulates collagen and elastin production, firming and enhancing skin elasticity over about four weeks.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        More than just an aesthetic treatment, facial acupuncture benefits the whole body, improving digestion, immunity, and blood flow. It’s a gentle alternative to invasive procedures, addressing signs of aging, such as wrinkles or a double chin, and can even extend the results of cosmetic procedures. Beyond looking refreshed, patients often feel a sense of emotional release, experiencing greater peace and confidence.
    </p><br>



    <h2 class="subtitle">After Treatment</h2>
    <p>
        After your acupuncture session, you may feel deeply relaxed or mildly fatigued. This is a normal response as your body activates its natural healing process, which can require energy. We encourage you to rest afterward, allowing your body to fully absorb and benefit from the treatment, continuing your healing journey.
