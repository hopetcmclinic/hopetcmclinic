        Acupuncture is a holistic healing practice that aims to restore balance and promote overall well-being. Each treatment is uniquely tailored to meet your specific needs, starting with a comprehensive diagnosis and continuing with a variety of effective techniques designed to address your concerns.
    </p><br>
    
    <h2 class="subtitle">Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>
        The first step in your acupuncture journey is a thorough assessment to better understand your health, identify any imbalances, and customize a treatment plan just for you.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        During your initial visit, your acupuncturist will review your health history, lifestyle, and any current symptoms or concerns. 
        A detailed physical examination will include checking your pulse, examining your tongue, performing abdominal palpation, and discussing your overall well-being to gain a comprehensive understanding of your condition.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        In follow-up visits, your acupuncturist will assess your progress, make adjustments to your treatment as needed, and continue to support your body’s natural healing process. As new symptoms arise, your treatment plan will evolve to reflect your changing needs.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Treatments</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="/blogs/acupuncture.html"><strong>Acupuncture</strong></a> involves the use of ultra-thin, sterile needles inserted at specific angles and depths to stimulate acupoints—targeted areas that help balance Qi and blood flow throughout the body. This process promotes both physical and emotional harmony, addressing discomfort and underlying health issues. Our skilled acupuncturists tailor each session to your individual needs, selecting techniques to optimize your energy flow and support your healing. These may include:

        <ul class="list-disc list-outside pl-6 my-4 space-y-4">            
            <li><strong>Spirit of Acupuncture (针灵)</strong>: This technique focuses on adjusting the superficial Wei Qi by using pulse diagnosis to assess the balance of Qi in the meridians and organs. Rooted in classical Chinese medicine, it accounts for the unique pulse characteristics in men and women, where Qi flow direction varies. Balancing these pulses allows acupuncturists to harmonize Qi and enhance the effectiveness of treatment. This method integrates pulse assessment with reinforcing and reducing techniques for precise, individualized therapy.</li>
            <li><strong>Trigger Point Therapy</strong>: This approach combines three effective and complementary techniques: acupuncture, Intramuscular Stimulation (IMS), and trigger-point acupuncture. Together, these therapies provide a comprehensive solution for managing chronic pain, relieving musculoskeletal discomfort, and enhancing mobility. By uniting the holistic benefits of acupuncture, the precision of IMS, and the targeted focus of trigger point therapy, each treatment is customized to meet individual needs, working synergistically to alleviate pain, restore function, and support overall well-being.</li>
            
            <li><a href="/blogs/facial-rejuvenation-acupuncture.html"><strong>Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture</strong></a>: A holistic approach to rejuvenating the face and body, this treatment improves circulation and stimulates collagen production to reduce wrinkles, promote skin elasticity, and provide a healthy glow. Over the course of several weeks, facial acupuncture enhances both your physical appearance and your overall well-being.
                This holistic treatment not only improves the skin but also supports overall health, including digestive function, immunity, and emotional balance. Facial acupuncture can extend the effects of cosmetic treatments like Botox or serve as a non-invasive alternative.
            </li>
            <li><a href="/blogs/fu_subcutaneous_needling.html"><strong>Fu's Subcutaneous Needling</strong></a>: A precise technique designed to address both superficial and deep imbalances, promoting quicker healing and pain relief.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Method Acupuncture</strong>: A system of acupuncture that balances energy flow across the body to treat both symptoms and underlying causes of imbalances.</li>
            
            
            <li><strong>Auricular Acupuncture</strong>: Small black seeds of cow-herb are secured on the ear with a piece of tape over specific acupressure points. The seeds stimulate the point by mild pressure. This therapy is especially suitable for children and adults who are afraid of needles.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><a href="/blogs/cupping.html"><strong>Cupping</strong></a>: This technique uses special cups placed on the skin to create gentle suction, improving blood circulation, relieving muscle tension, and reducing inflammation.</li>
            <li><a href="/blogs/moxibustion.html"><strong>Moxibustion</strong></a>: Dried mugwort (moxa) is burned near the skin to warm and invigorate the body’s Qi, particularly beneficial for cold or stagnant conditions.</li>

    <h2 class="subtitle">After Treatment</h2>
    <p>
        Following your acupuncture session, you may feel deeply relaxed or experience mild fatigue as your body activates its natural healing processes. This is a normal response, and it is recommended that you rest afterward to allow your body to absorb the benefits of the treatment.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        We suggest taking it easy for the rest of the day to support your healing journey. If you feel significantly affected by the treatment, please ensure you have a safe means of transportation home.
